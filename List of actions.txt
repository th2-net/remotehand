2. Notes
All actions that wait for some element will check the page contents till given element appears or till given number of seconds passes, throwing ScriptExecuteException is no element had appeared in time.

Possible <locator> values:
1. cssSelector - in this case <matcher> should contain CSS path to the element like this: div.v-button.v-widget.default.v-button-default;
2. xpath - <matcher> should contain XPath to the element, for example: //button[contains(@class, 'v-nativebutton v-widget')];
3. tagName - in this case <matcher> is a tag name of the element;
4. id - then <matcher> contains id of the element.

Remote Hand can use web element dictionary (webdictionary.csv), which contains list of web elements by tags: #id,#locator,#matcher,#type,#desc.
Example:
#id,#locator,#matcher,#type,#desc
click1,xpath,<matcher>,button,some button...
click2,cssSelector,<matcher>,link,some link...
//you can specify comment
sendKeys1,xpath,<matcher>,input,some input...

You can use in script the parameter 'webId', Remote Hand will replace it with 'locator' and 'matcher'. But these parameters can not be used together!
